# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict the survival chances of Titanic passengers using the famous Kaggle dataset.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation techniques in Python.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on factors like age, gender, class, and family size.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- *Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- *Platform:* Kaggle Notebook / Jupyter Notebook

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🎯 Accuracy
Achieved around 82% accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier after hyperparameter tuning.

## 🪄 Key Steps
1. Handled missing data and outliers.  
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.  
3. Engineered new features like Family Size and Title.  
4. Trained multiple ML models and compared their performance.  
5. Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrix.
